After Video time 26:00 keeping notes about Testing and JUnit:

 	- TESTING
		* Unit Testing is many tests performed on small parts of code (like methods)
		that can be performed by a single programmer on his own code (before he merges
		it with the code of other programmers). These tests should all be kept and
		performed again after code changes.
		
		* Integration Testing is the testing of the merged code of many programmers that
		they can perform together and shows if the parts of code communicate as it should
		with the other parts
		
		* System Testing is the testing of the merged code of many programmers that
		they can perform together and shows if the total code produces the results that 
		it should
		
		* Client Requirement Testing is done to check if the program meets the client's
		requirements
		
		* We should keep all the unit tests we perform somewhere in our project, so when we
		add features (e.g. we added a method in a class) we can perform all the already passed
		tests again from the beginning, to ensure that we didn't broke anything else.

		* Test First Approach is when you write the testing method before you write the code
		By doing this you got the tests before you complete the code, and the most important
		means that you know very well what exactly you want to do with the code.
