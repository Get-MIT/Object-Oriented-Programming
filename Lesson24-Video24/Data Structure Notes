Data Structures Notes


When we create our own data structures:
	
	- Creating a list:			
		NameElement			
		----------			
		Name				
		next				
		----------			
		getName()			
		getNext()			
		setName()			
		setNext()			
		

		LISTS:
			can have same object more than once
			must have indexes
			
		SETS:
			don't have indexes
			can't contain the same object many times
			
			
	JAVA has the Java Collections Framework (java.util.Collection)
		it's a set of interfaces and classes
			all collections have some methods like add, remove, contains, size etc...
				
				LIST collections have extra methods like get(index), set(index)
					ArrayList, LinkList...
					
				SET collections like TreeSet have extra methods like hashCode()
					HashSet, TreeSet
			
				QUEUE collections 
					Queues have the logic that objects are "waiting" to use them, and first in will be the first out
					(like a printer printjob queue)
			
				MAP collections
					maps are mostly used for couples of key and value
